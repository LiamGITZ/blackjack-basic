**The Game**
the game is a standard version of blak jack with the abiity to bet an 
arbitray amount of starting money and play with any desired number of decks

the game continues with hands untill either the user is finished the decks of cards reach a minium 
amount or the user has run out of currency to bet with

**Execution**
*program*
can simply call python 3.6 or higher on the zip file or topmost directory
*tests*
call pthon3.6 or higher on "class_test.py" in the tests directory


**Choices**
*language*
I chose to implement the game using python since I haven't coded in the language for
over 5 years and wanted to remember the language and pthon has many powerfull tools 
for string manipulation as well as its uniquely dynamic nature as compared to C,C++,and Java 
which I have been using in most of my classes

*data structure*
The main data structure I used was Pthon lists as they are extremely versatile and have an 
array of functionality that make them very powerfull in terms of usability
while they may not be the most efficient data structure they served their purpose for
making my game and are easily fast enough for this purpose

*libraries*
random - psuedo random values for game variables such as dealing and shuffling cards
enum - for distinguishing/defining card values
os/sys - for terminal output help
